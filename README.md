# ORSO: Online Resource for Social Omics

ORSO (Online Resource for Social Omics) is a web application designed to help users find next generation sequencing (NGS) datasets relevant to their research interests. ORSO performs this task by creating and maintaining a network of datasets connected based on similarity in primary read coverage values and annotated metadata. An ORSO user can follow these connections to discover datasets with similar characteristics. ORSO is also a social network. Users may favorite datasets and follow other users, creating new connections that influence how datasets are recommended.

For instructions on how to use the ORSO web application, please see the [ORSO user manual](https://github.com/lavenderca/genomics-network/blob/master/docs/user_manual.md). We also provide documentation for installation and administration in the [ORSO developer manual](https://github.com/lavenderca/genomics-network/blob/master/docs/dev_manual.md).
